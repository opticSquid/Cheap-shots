# Important Points
- Incase you are adding a new template see if there was a `Template-request`; if there link it with the PR.
- If no `Template-request` found and you are adding the template on your own you can go forward without linking any issue.
- If you are fixing any issue on an existing template make sure to link the issue with your PR.

## Make sure to have these things in mind

- [ ] Your template is self sufficient.
- [ ] Your template runs on `localhost:3000`
- [ ] You have a readme file explaining your template in as easy language as possible.
- [ ] Your whole template is contained in a single folder and named in a meaningful way according to the purpose it serves. (ex: folder name: `Todo-List`; purpose of template: Template of a TODO list app  ).

## Incase of fixing issues in an existing template
- [ ] Your PR meets the above requirements.
