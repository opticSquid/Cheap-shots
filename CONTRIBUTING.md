# Contributinng Guidelines

------------

1. Each and every template should be independent of other templates. Meaning each template will have its own seperate set of dependencies and should be self sufficient.
2. Every project should be configured to run on localhost:3000
3. A seperate `readme.md` file should be provided explaining all the ins and outs of the template.
4. Tech stack can be of your choice. But it should be mentioned in the `readme.md` file.
5. Proper instructions should be given to run the template in local environment.
